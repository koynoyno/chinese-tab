Make learning Chinese easy — **learn words every time you open a new tab**.

Chinese Tab is a free browser extension for practicing Chinese. It doesn't track you, doesn't show ads and it works fast on any device.

In fact, **it works faster than the default Chrome new tab**.

## What can I do with Chinese Tab?

📚 Prepare for the New HSK 3.0 exam (Standard HSK exam available as well)

🀄 Choose between simplified and traditional characters

🌈 Memorizing tones can be tough — turn on tone coloring

📖 Learn how to use the word with sentence examples

🎯 Set the limit of words per day to learn the new level more efficiently...

♾️ ...Or practice with no limit at all

🤓 Turn off pinyin and translation for hardcore mode. You can always peek the meaning by hovering over the word

📣 Show off your Chinese skills by sharing words you learned on your Twitter or Facebook page

🌙 Turn on dark mode to learn in the evening without straining your eyes

📴 There's no Wi-Fi around? Chinese Tab works offline

⚡ No charger either? Chinese Tab increases laptop battery life by consuming less power than the default new tab
## I love this extension! Any way I can help?

I'm developing another browser extension that helps you to learn Chinese without an effort while browsing the Internet. Connect it to Chinese Tab and add words and sentences from the things you read.

No ads, no tracking, and free for everyone.

Watch me building in public, vote for features, and contribute to building the greatest extension for fun Chinese microlearning.
